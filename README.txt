About the Project

This project is the part of the assignment 3.
This application mainly works with the REST API.  I have used mongodb to store the data.

REST API: We can verify using the POSTMAN
I have implemented all four GET, POST, PUT, DELETE which I have verified with POSTMAN and running fine.
NOTE: DELETE method will check the quantity, if the quantity is one then it will delete the whole docuent. Else it will decrease the quantity.

Express app is using REST API to perform select and create task.
On the homepage we can see the list of the foods and on the add item page we can add new food item.
